## Given a string, you need to return a new string where every letter is shifted to its right by one place in alphabetical order. The last letters z and Z should be replaced with the first ones: a and A, respectively. If the character isn't a letter, it should stay the same.

## It is not allowed to use string built-in methods here.

## For example, given the string "abc123XYz!", the function should return "bcd123YZa!".
