## Given a string input_string, your task is to write a function that transforms all the lowercase letters to uppercase and all the uppercase letters to lowercase. If the character ## is not a letter, do not transform it.

# The transformation should be done without using any built-in Python methods, it is not allowed to use built-in Python functions like lower(), upper(), or similar in your code.

# For example, for the input string "HelLo WoRld 123", the output should be "hELlO wOrLD 123".
