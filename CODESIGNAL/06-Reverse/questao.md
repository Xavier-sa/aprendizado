#            You are given a string, and your task is to check whether the provided string is a palindrome, without using any built-in string methods. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward, ignoring the casing of letters ('A' and 'a' are considered the same) and ignoring non-letter characters.

#           Return a boolean value: True if the string is a palindrome and False if it is not.

#          It is not allowed to use Python built-in functions like reverse(), reversed(), or similar in this task.
